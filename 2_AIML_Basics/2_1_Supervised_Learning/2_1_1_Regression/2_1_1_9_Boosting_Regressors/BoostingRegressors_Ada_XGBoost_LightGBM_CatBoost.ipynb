        "### 1️⃣ **AdaBoost Regressor**\n",
        "\n",
        "🧸 **Imagine you're learning to throw a ball into a basket.**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You try once. You miss badly.\n",
        "2. Your coach sees where you missed and gives you a **small correction**: “Aim a little more to the right!”\n",
        "3. You try again, but still miss — just not as badly.\n",
        "4. Your coach keeps helping with **tiny adjustments**.\n",
        "5. Eventually, after many tries, you’re throwing the ball into the basket! 🎯\n",
        "\n",
        "📌 That’s AdaBoost!\n",
        "It builds many **tiny models** (like shallow trees), each focusing on the **mistakes of the last one**.\n",
        "👉 It gives **more importance to wrong guesses** from previous models.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2️⃣ **XGBoost Regressor**\n",
        "\n",
        "🛠️ **Imagine you’re using a super fancy robot to throw the ball into the basket.**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The robot watches your first throw.\n",
        "2. It calculates exactly how wrong you were, and **how to fix it** — like a GPS correction.\n",
        "3. Then it **adds regularization** (like: “Don’t overdo it!”), to avoid throwing it too hard.\n",
        "4. Also, it’s **fast and smart**: it learns from many people at once (parallel), avoids repeating mistakes, and handles large stadiums.\n",
        "\n",
        "📌 That’s XGBoost!\n",
        "It’s like **AdaBoost with a brainy robot**. It uses **gradient descent, regularization, and parallelism** to learn better and faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3️⃣ **LightGBM Regressor**\n",
        "\n",
        "⚡ **Imagine a super-fast robot that not only throws the ball well, but zooms around while learning.**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. It builds trees **very fast** by grouping data into **bins** (like putting ages 21–25 in one box).\n",
        "2. It also grows trees **from the leaves** (not top-down), which means it **focuses deeply on the errors**.\n",
        "3. It’s great for huge stadiums with **millions of throws**.\n",
        "\n",
        "📌 That’s LightGBM!\n",
        "It’s **super fast**, **leaf-wise smart**, and best when you have **lots of data**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4️⃣ **CatBoost Regressor**\n",
        "\n",
        "🐱 **Imagine a helpful cat who sees you’re confused by categories like “Petrol” vs “Diesel”.**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You tell the cat, “I don’t know how to throw based on car type.”\n",
        "2. The cat says, “I understand categories! I’ll take care of it for you.” 🐈\n",
        "3. Then it does boosting **like LightGBM**, but **automatically handles categories**, even ones you didn’t convert.\n",
        "\n",
        "📌 That’s CatBoost!\n",
        "It’s the **best friend of anyone with categorical data** — no need to manually encode.\n",
        "It’s **accurate, easy, and good with small or large data**.\n",
