        "\n",
        "Let‚Äôs first understand **where KNN fits in the world of Machine Learning** and what kind of algorithm it is.\n",
        "\n",
        "KNN is a **Supervised Learning** algorithm. That means it learns from **labeled examples**‚Äîdata where the correct answers (labels) are already known. For example, you might have a dataset with information like vehicle speed, acceleration, and braking behavior, and each entry is labeled ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù or ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, KNN is unique in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Instance-Based Learning**: Most algorithms (like logistic regression or neural networks) try to **learn a pattern or formula** from the data. But KNN doesn‚Äôt do that. It **remembers** the entire training dataset and **uses it directly** when it sees new data. That's called **instance-based** because it uses actual instances (examples) at prediction time.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Lazy Learner**: Unlike ‚Äúeager‚Äù learners that do all the work up front (training), KNN **does no real learning** until it needs to make a prediction. That‚Äôs why it's called **lazy**‚Äîit stores everything and only works when asked to answer a question.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Non-parametric**: Most models try to fit a specific shape (line, curve, etc.) to the data. KNN doesn‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt assume anything about the shape of the decision boundary‚Äîit lets the data speak for itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "üîß **When do you use KNN?**\n",
        "Use KNN when:\n",
        "\n",
        "* You have **small to medium-sized data**.\n",
        "* You want something that‚Äôs **simple** and doesn't require complex model training.\n",
        "* The decision depends a lot on **local examples** (e.g., behavior that clusters together).\n",

        "\n",
        "Think of KNN like asking your neighbors for advice. Suppose you just moved into a neighborhood and want to know if a restaurant nearby is good. You ask your 5 closest neighbors (K=5). If 4 of them say it's good, you assume it probably is.\n",
