- Basic ML models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.)
- Data preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation

### 🔹 Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
- Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes
- KMeans, PCA, DBSCAN

### 🔹 Deep Learning
- Neural Network foundations
- MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM architectures (with PyTorch and TensorFlow)
- Custom training scripts and mini projects

### 🔹 Computer Vision
- Image classification and object detection
- YOLOv5/YOLOv8 examples
- OpenCV-based experiments

### 🔹 M.Tech Dissertation Project
**Title:** _Trajectory Prediction and Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Vehicles in Adverse Weather using V2X Communication_

Includes:
- YOLOv8-based object detection
